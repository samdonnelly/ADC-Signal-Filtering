# ADC Signal Filtering

This program filters a sample of ADC data to eliminate noise and get more accurate results and write those results to a file for plotting. 

This code is intnded for implementation on microcontrollers that do ADC conversions on analog siganls from external sensors. More specifically it is made for the bike-data-aquisition-stm32f4 and brma-stm32f2 projects that can be found in my repos. The code was created and tested here before being implemented and tested on hardware. 

THis repo also contains a python script used for plotting the before and after results of the filtering scheme.
